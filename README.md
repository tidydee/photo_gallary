A jQuery photo gallary

## A jQeury Application that connects to the Instagram API using AJAX.

#### The application listens for the 20 most recent posted pictures on that were placed in the Lighthouse Catagory
* The app refreshes itself every 5 minutes.
* Using javascript & jQeury I designed a elegent looking photo gallary that displays the images in a fashionable manner.
